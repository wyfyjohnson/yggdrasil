# Yggdrasil - NixOS flake

## Wyatt's personal flake project for his NixOS endeavor

This is just a little flake project to distract me and keep me sane. I am trying out NixOS again and figured it was about time I attempt this project but with one condition that the repo is to remain public. I want to have a fully tailored/riced experience regardless of host.

## This is a header for a visual section
Maybe put some visual content here, like screenshots of my desktop with NixOS websites pulled up
More than likely want a link here for an iso or my future iso project

## Installation
There are a few things you will need to do to get this flake working. If you are reading this repo, you more than likely already know how to istall a flake and can disregard the followiing.

* NixOS installation
* flakes enabled
* internet access
* Foobar

You will need to clone this repo:

```git clone https://codeberg.org/wyfy/yggdrasil.git```

`cd yggdrasil`
